# Installing dependencies

First, you will need to install the dependencies of the project on the cmd or bash for this run the following command

```bash
yarn add
```

# Running the aplication

## Execute the metro server

Once you have installed the dependencies you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# On android
npx react-native run-android
# On IOS
npx react-native run-ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
